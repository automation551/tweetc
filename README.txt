This Twitter client has three modes of operation:

1) If password/username is not set, it will ask for username and password and store it in the preferences file.

2) If no arguments are passed, and the password and username are already saved in the preference file,
it will retrieve the last updates from that user's feed.

3) If arguments are passed, and the password and username are in the preferences file, it will try to post them as a tweet to the account defined by the password/username in the preferences file.
